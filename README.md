#INTERA
Simple game developed in AngularJS intended to help kids with reading issues. The game was designed as a side-project to learn AngularJS. It was not properly tested in production mode so some bugs were not fixed. 
The game has four modes that can be played individually or together in a random stream.
To play a game just click it and make sure it's selected. If you want to play in random stream select multiple games. Then hit the big button at the top.
The game has to be played from a server (since CORS issue). It's been tested with Node and PHP.
